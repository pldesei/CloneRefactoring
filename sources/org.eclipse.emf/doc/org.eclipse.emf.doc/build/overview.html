		EMF is a modeling framework and code generation facility for building tools and other applications based on a 
		structured data model. From a model specification described in XMI, EMF provides tools and runtime support to 
		produce a set of Java classes for the model, a set of adapter classes that enable viewing and command-based 
		editing of the model, and a basic editor. Models can be specified using annotated Java, XML documents, or 
		modeling tools like Rational Rose, then imported into EMF. Most important of all, EMF provides the foundation 
		for interoperability with other EMF-based tools and applications.

		The following packages contain the classes that implement the several features provided by EMF, including:
		<ul>
			<li>an <a href="org/eclipse/emf/ecore/package-summary.html#details">API</a> for the Ecore Model;</li>
			<li>an <a href="org/eclipse/emf/ecore/resource/package-summary.html#details">API</a> for modeling abstract persistent resources; and</li>
			<li>an <a href="org/eclipse/emf/ecore/change/package-summary.html#details">API</a> for modeling changes to instances of EMF models.</li>
		</ul>
