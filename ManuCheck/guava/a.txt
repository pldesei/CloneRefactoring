18:678:Simplify and organize various Map implementations.  Specifically:
54:229:Create an abstract base class for our graph implementations. Eliminate lots of redundant code! Also improves the (currently incorrectly documented) runtime of removeNode() in IncidenceSetUndirectedGraph on multigraphs from O(degree^2) to O(degree). ------------- Created by MOE: https://github.com/google/moe MOE_MIGRATED_REVID=114995238
55:214:Major refactoring of the com.google.common.graph APIs (including updates to client code): -Remove DirectedGraph and UndirectedGraph interfaces; a Graph's directedness can now be queried with graph.isDirected(). -Remove GraphConfig class; use the query methods directly on the Graph interface instead. -Add GraphBuilder; use this instead of Graphs.create[Un]Directed(GraphConfig) -Remove ImmutableGraph.Builder; ImmutableGraph construction is now done with ImmutableGraph.copyOf(Graph). -Rename multigraph() to allowsParallelEdges(boolean). -Rename noSelfLoops() to allowsSelfLoops(boolean).
66:203:Graph.java: break out mutation- and edge-specific methods into subinterfaces: * Network.java: edge-specific methods (extends Graph) * MutableGraph.java: mutation methods for Graph (extends Graph) * MutableNetwork.java: mutation methods for Network (extends Network) Graph<N, E> becomes Graph<N>.
70:162:Redesign of MapMakerInternalMap with the motivation of saving a lot of memory by not wastefully having stuff that's unneeded. The algorithm (the j.u.concurrent.ConcurrentHashMap-inspired segments of hash tables) is untouched.
